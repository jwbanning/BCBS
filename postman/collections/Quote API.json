		"description": "This collection represents 4 different interfaces that can be used to verify class code availability (Risk Appetite), determine what coverages may be offered (Coverages), create and update a Quote (Quote) and determine what forms are available for that Quote (Forms List).\n\nA Quote may start as a simple Quick Quote and then advance into a Full Quote by calling the Quote API again as many times as needed.  Any Quote request may update Limits, add or removing Class Codes,  add or remove Forms, Coverages, and Additional Insureds or even adjust Subjectivities, Taxes and Fees.  Requests may combine these changes into a single call, or make a unique request for each change that is desired.\n\nThe completed Quote may be Bound by utilizing the ResumeLink to link the end-user directly into the Digital Workbench to finalize the new Quote.\n\nAs of Q2 2020 the Quote API supports General Liability, with Property scheduled to be added later in the year.\n",

			"description": "The Quote API is designed to create, update and view a quote within the Ategrity Digital Workbench.  The interface can accept almost any data that can be added to a quote through the Digital Workbench and is designed to be very tolerant to requests that may be missing data or have invalid data.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe goal of the Quote API is to provide a valid quote even if portions of the request may be missing or may contain invalid data.  If limited data is provided in the request, the Quote API will use default values for any fields that may be missing.  If invalid values are requested, the Quote API will attempt to adjust the invalid values to the next acceptable value so that a valid quote can be returned without re-submitting the request. To ensure the calling system can represent the quote properly, it is important to review the “Notice” section of the API response.  The Notice section will provide a list of all values that were found invalid or any forms that may have been in conflict.  This section should be reviewed to ensure that the consuming system reflects the quote properly.  Any items listed within the notice section should be read from the response and updated within the requesting system.  ",
